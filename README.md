🚌 Exploring the Travego Travellers Database: Unveiling Insights into Bus Travel! 🌍

Welcome aboard the journey through the Travego Travellers Database, where we track passengers and prices for bus travel between cities. Strap in as we dive into the fascinating world of SQL and database management. Let's embark on this adventure together! 🚀

Project Overview:
In this project, we set out to create, populate, and query two tables in the Travego schema: Passengers and Prices. From inserting data to retrieving insights, we explored the capabilities of SQL to manage our database effectively.

Highlights:

Setting the Stage: Created the Travego schema and designed tables with precise column names and data types, ensuring optimal storage efficiency and data integrity. 🎭
Boarding Passengers: Populated our tables with passenger information, capturing their journeys and ticket details for both Sitting and Sleeper buses. 🎟️
Destination Insights: Embarked on a journey of discovery with SQL queries to uncover valuable insights:
How many adventurous female passengers embarked on long-distance journeys of 600KMs or more?
Exploring passenger details for those traveling over 500KMs in a Sleeper bus.
Selecting passengers whose names start with the letter 'S' for special recognition.
Calculating ticket prices based on boarding and destination cities, bus type, and distance traveled.
Unveiling ticket prices for passengers covering 1000KMs in a Sitting bus.
Determining the fare for a scenic trip from Bangalore to Panaji for our esteemed passenger, Pallavi.
Enhancing comfort by updating bus categories to "Non-AC" for Sleeper buses.
Saying farewell to a passenger named Piyush by gracefully removing their entry from our database.
Cleaning up our records by truncating the Passenger table, ready for future adventures.
Conclusion:
The Travego Travellers Database has provided us with a window into the dynamic world of bus travel, showcasing the power of SQL in managing and analyzing data. As we continue our journey, let's leverage these insights to enhance the travel experience for passengers worldwide
